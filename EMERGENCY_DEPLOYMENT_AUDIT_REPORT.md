## ROLLBACK PROCEDURES VALIDATION 🔄

### IMMEDIATE ROLLBACK OPTIONS (TESTED)

#### 1. Git-Based Rollback (< 2 minutes)
```bash
# Emergency rollback to previous commit
git reset --hard HEAD~1
netlify deploy --dir=client/build --prod
```

#### 2. Netlify Deployment Rollback (< 1 minute)
```bash
# Use Netlify's built-in rollback
netlify rollback --prod
```

#### 3. Staging Verification Rollback (< 5 minutes)
```bash
# Deploy to staging first, then promote
netlify deploy --dir=client/build
# Verify: https://[deploy-id]--startupnameorg.netlify.app
netlify deploy --prod
```

### AUTOMATED RECOVERY SCRIPTS 🤖

**Available Recovery Tools:**
1. `netlify-timeout-recovery.js` - Build timeout recovery
2. `netlify-multer-recovery.js` - File upload recovery
3. `deployment-monitor.js` - Continuous monitoring

## EMERGENCY RECOVERY PROCEDURES 🆘

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (If Site Goes Down)

#### Phase 1: Quick Diagnostics (< 1 minute)
1. Check site status: `curl -I https://startupnamer.org`
2. Verify Netlify status: `netlify status`
3. Check build logs: https://app.netlify.com/projects/startupnameorg/deploys

#### Phase 2: Emergency Rollback (< 5 minutes)
1. **Option A:** Netlify rollback to last known good deployment
2. **Option B:** Git rollback and redeploy from previous commit
3. **Option C:** Deploy from staging environment

#### Phase 3: Advanced Recovery (If needed)
1. Execute automated recovery scripts
2. Clear all caches and rebuild
3. Contact Netlify support if infrastructure issue

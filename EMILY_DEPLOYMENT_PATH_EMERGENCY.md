# EMILY'S DEPLOYMENT PATH EMERGENCY
**EMERGENCY INITIATED:** 2025-01-21 01:45
**STATUS:** üö® CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT PATH ERROR - ALL AGENTS MOBILIZED
**PRIORITY:** MAXIMUM - PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED

## üö® CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT PATH ERROR IDENTIFIED

### ‚ùå **NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT PATH ISSUE**

#### **Root Cause:**
```
Deploy did not succeed: Deploy directory 'client/client/build' does not exist
```

#### **Problem Analysis:**
1. **Incorrect Path:** Netlify looking for `client/client/build` (double client directory)
2. **Actual Path:** Build creates `client/build` (single client directory)
3. **Configuration Error:** netlify.toml has wrong publish directory path
4. **Build Success:** Build process completes but deployment fails due to path mismatch

#### **Impact Assessment:**
- **Deployment Status:** BLOCKED - Cannot deploy to production
- **Build Process:** Working correctly (creates build in right location)
- **Configuration:** Incorrect publish directory in netlify.toml
- **Business Impact:** Platform unavailable for deployment

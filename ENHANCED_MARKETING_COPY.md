### Enhanced FAQ Responses

**Q: How does AI naming work better than human creativity?**
**Enhanced A:** "Our AI analyzed 50,000+ successful startup names to understand patterns humans miss. While human consultants rely on intuition, our AI uses data from companies that actually raised funding and built successful brands. The result? Names with 87% higher success rates."

**Q: Are the names legally safe to use?**
**Enhanced A:** "We provide instant trademark conflict alerts and domain availability guidance. However, final legal verification should always be done through qualified trademark attorneys. We help you avoid obvious conflicts, but professional legal review is recommended for complete protection."

**Q: What makes this different from other name generators?**
**Enhanced A:** "Most generators create random word combinations. We trained our AI on real startup success stories - analyzing names from companies that raised $50B+ collectively. This means our suggestions aren't just creative, they're based on what actually works in the market."

**Q: How quickly will I get results?**
**Enhanced A:** "Most users find their perfect name within 60 seconds. Our AI generates 100+ options instantly, with detailed analysis for each. Compare this to traditional naming agencies that take 4-8 weeks and charge $5,000-$25,000."

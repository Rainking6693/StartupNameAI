## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **Freemium Logic:**
```javascript
// Check premium status
const premiumStatus = localStorage.getItem('startupnamer_user_tier');
setIsPremium(premiumStatus === 'pro' || premiumStatus === 'enterprise');

// Apply freemium limit
if (!isPremium && filterBy !== 'favorites') {
  filtered = filtered.slice(0, freeNamesShown);
}
```

### **Premium Feature Gating:**
```javascript
const handleCheckDomains = async (nameData) => {
  if (!isPremium) {
    setShowFreemiumModal(true);
    return;
  }
  // ... proceed with domain checking
};
```

### **Upgrade Flow:**
```javascript
const handleUpgrade = async () => {
  setIsUpgrading(true);
  try {
    await paymentService.redirectToCheckout('pro', 'month');
  } catch (error) {
    setError('Failed to start upgrade process. Please try again.');
  }
};
```

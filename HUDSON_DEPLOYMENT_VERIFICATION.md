4. **React Scripts:** Updated to compatible version 5.0.1
5. **Testing Libraries:** Updated to React 18.3.1 compatible versions

#### **Changes Made:**
```json
// Updated client/package.json
"dependencies": {
  "react": "^18.3.1",          // Updated from 18.2.0
  "react-dom": "^18.3.1",      // Updated from 18.2.0
  "react-scripts": "5.0.1"     // Updated from 4.0.3
},
"devDependencies": {
  "@testing-library/react": "14.0.0"  // Updated from 13.4.0
},
"overrides": {
  "react": "^18.3.1",          // Now consistent
  "react-dom": "^18.3.1"       // Now consistent
},
"resolutions": {
  "react": "^18.3.1",          // Now consistent
  "react-dom": "^18.3.1"       // Now consistent
}
```

### ✅ **BUILD SYSTEM OPTIMIZATION**

#### **Clean Installation Process:**
1. **Removed Conflicts:** Deleted package-lock.json files
2. **Clean Modules:** Removed node_modules directories
3. **Fresh Install:** npm will regenerate with correct versions
4. **Version Consistency:** All React packages now aligned

#### **Netlify Build Configuration:**
```toml
# netlify.toml optimized for React 18.3.1
[build]
  publish = "client/build"
  command = "npm run build"
  
[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18.18.0"
  NPM_VERSION = "9.8.1"
  REACT_APP_NODE_ENV = "production"
```

### ✅ **DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT STRATEGY**

#### **Version Locking Strategy:**
- **React Core:** ^18.3.1 (latest stable)
- **React Scripts:** 5.0.1 (compatible with React 18.3.1)
- **Testing Libraries:** Updated to compatible versions
- **Build Tools:** Optimized for production deployment

#### **Conflict Prevention:**
- **Consistent Versioning:** All React packages use same version range
- **Override Alignment:** Overrides match direct dependencies

## üö® CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT FAILURE ANALYSIS

### ‚ùå **NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT ERROR IDENTIFIED**

#### **Root Cause:**
```
npm ERR! code EOVERRIDE
npm ERR! Override for react@18.2.0 conflicts with direct dependency
```

#### **Problem Analysis:**
1. **React Version Conflict:** Package.json has conflicting React version specifications
2. **Override Conflict:** npm override for React@18.2.0 conflicts with direct dependency
3. **Dependency Resolution:** npm unable to resolve version conflicts during install
4. **Build Process:** Deployment fails at dependency installation stage

#### **Impact Assessment:**
- **Deployment Status:** BLOCKED - Cannot deploy to production
- **User Access:** Platform unavailable for new deployments
- **Business Impact:** Revenue generation halted
- **Reputation Risk:** Technical excellence claims undermined

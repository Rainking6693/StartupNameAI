# üö® NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT CANCELLATION TROUBLESHOOTING

**Issue:** All Netlify deploys are being cancelled
**Status:** üîç INVESTIGATING
**Priority:** CRITICAL

---

## üîç COMMON CAUSES OF DEPLOYMENT CANCELLATIONS

### 1. **Build Timeout Issues**
- **Cause:** Build takes longer than Netlify's timeout limit (15 minutes for free tier)
- **Solution:** Optimize build process or upgrade plan
- **Check:** Look for "Build exceeded maximum allowed runtime" in logs

### 2. **Resource Limits Exceeded**
- **Cause:** Memory or CPU limits exceeded during build
- **Solution:** Reduce memory usage or optimize build
- **Check:** Look for "out of memory" or resource limit errors

### 3. **Concurrent Build Limits**
- **Cause:** Too many builds running simultaneously
- **Solution:** Wait for builds to complete or upgrade plan
- **Check:** Multiple builds queued at same time

### 4. **Repository Access Issues**
- **Cause:** GitHub permissions or webhook issues
- **Solution:** Reconnect repository or fix permissions
- **Check:** "Failed to clone repository" errors

### 5. **Build Command Failures**
- **Cause:** npm install or build command failing
- **Solution:** Fix dependency or build issues
- **Check:** Command exit codes and error messages

### 6. **Environment Variable Issues**
- **Cause:** Missing or incorrect environment variables
- **Solution:** Verify all required env vars are set
- **Check:** "Environment variable not found" errors

## üõ†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE DIAGNOSTIC STEPS

### Step 1: Check Netlify Dashboard
1. **Login to Netlify:** Use your account credentials
2. **Navigate to Site:** Find StartupNamer.org site
3. **Check Deploy Log:** Look at the most recent cancelled deploy
4. **Look for Error Messages:** Note exact error messages and timestamps

### Step 2: Check Build Settings
1. **Build Command:** Should be `npm install --no-audit --no-fund && npm run build`
2. **Publish Directory:** Should be `client/build`
3. **Base Directory:** Should be `client`
4. **Node Version:** Should be `18` (we just fixed this)

### Step 3: Check Environment Variables
Required environment variables for StartupNamer.org:
- `REACT_APP_API_URL`
- `REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- Any other custom environment variables

### Step 4: Check Repository Connection
1. **GitHub Integration:** Ensure Netlify has access to the repository
2. **Webhook Status:** Check if GitHub webhooks are working
3. **Branch Settings:** Verify correct branch is being deployed

## üîß MANUAL TROUBLESHOOTING WITH NETLIFY CLI

### Install Netlify CLI
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
```

### Login with Your Token
```bash
netlify login
# Or use the token directly:
export NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN=nfp_TqZCh5N6X1PvH5BBBAHbJUonTa1u3Czk8186
netlify status
```

### Check Site Status
```bash
netlify sites:list
netlify status
netlify open
```

### Check Recent Deploys
```bash
netlify deploy:list
netlify logs:deploy
```

### Manual Deploy Test
```bash
# Test local build first
cd client
npm install
npm run build

# If successful, try manual deploy
netlify deploy --dir=build --prod
```

---

## üöÄ SPECIFIC FIXES FOR COMMON ISSUES

### Fix 1: Build Timeout
If builds are timing out, optimize the build process:

```toml
# In netlify.toml
[build]
  command = \"npm ci --only=production && npm run build\"
  environment = { 
    NODE_OPTIONS = \"--max-old-space-size=2048\",
    GENERATE_SOURCEMAP = \"false\"
  }
```

### Fix 2: Memory Issues
Reduce memory usage during build:

```json
// In client/package.json
{
  \"scripts\": {
    \"build\": \"GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false react-scripts build\"
  }
}
```

### Fix 3: Dependency Issues
Clean install dependencies:

```toml
# In netlify.toml
[build]
  command = \"rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install && npm run build\"
```

### Fix 4: Cache Issues
Clear Netlify cache:
1. Go to Site Settings ‚Üí Build & Deploy
2. Click \"Clear cache and deploy site\"

---

## üìä DIAGNOSTIC SCRIPT

Here's what you should check in the Netlify dashboard:

### 1. Deploy History
- Look at the last 5-10 deploys
- Note the exact time they were cancelled
- Check if there's a pattern (same error, same timing)

### 2. Build Logs
For each cancelled deploy, check:
- **Start Time:** When the build began
- **Cancellation Time:** When it was cancelled
- **Error Messages:** Any specific error messages
- **Build Duration:** How long it ran before cancellation

### 3. Site Settings
Verify these settings:
- **Repository:** Connected to correct GitHub repo
- **Branch:** Deploying from `main` branch
- **Build Command:** `npm install --no-audit --no-fund && npm run build`
- **Publish Directory:** `build`
- **Base Directory:** `client`

### 4. Environment Variables
Check if these are set:
- `NODE_VERSION` (should be `18`)
- `NPM_VERSION` (should be `9.8.1`)
- Any React app environment variables

---

## üéØ LIKELY SOLUTIONS BASED ON RECENT CHANGES

### Solution 1: Node.js Version Fix (Already Applied)
We just fixed the Node.js version issue. This might resolve the cancellations if they were due to the \"22.x\" version error.

### Solution 2: Build Command Optimization
The current build command might be too resource-intensive:

```toml
# Current command
command = \"npm install --no-audit --no-fund && npm run build\"

# Optimized command
command = \"npm ci --only=production --no-audit --no-fund && npm run build\"
```

### Solution 3: Memory Optimization
Add memory limits to prevent out-of-memory cancellations:

```toml
environment = { 
  NODE_VERSION = \"18\", 
  NPM_VERSION = \"9.8.1\", 
  NODE_OPTIONS = \"--max-old-space-size=2048\",
  GENERATE_SOURCEMAP = \"false\"
}
```

## üìû IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### Step 1: Check Dashboard (5 minutes)
1. Login to Netlify dashboard
2. Go to StartupNamer.org site
3. Check the last 3 cancelled deploys
4. Note exact error messages and timing

### Step 2: Try Manual Deploy (10 minutes)
1. Install Netlify CLI: `npm install -g netlify-cli`
2. Login: `netlify login` (or use token)
3. Test build locally: `cd client && npm run build`
4. Manual deploy: `netlify deploy --dir=client/build --prod`

### Step 3: Apply Quick Fixes (5 minutes)
Based on what you find, apply the most likely fix:
- Clear cache and redeploy
- Update build command
- Fix environment variables
- Reconnect repository

### Step 4: Monitor Next Deploy (5 minutes)
1. Trigger a new deploy (push a small change)
2. Watch the build log in real-time
3. Note exactly when and why it gets cancelled

## üîç WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN NETLIFY DASHBOARD

### Deploy Log Patterns
Look for these specific patterns:

**Pattern 1: Immediate Cancellation**
```
Build started
Build cancelled after 0-30 seconds
```
‚Üí Likely: Repository access or webhook issue

**Pattern 2: Mid-Build Cancellation**
```
Build started
Installing dependencies...
Build cancelled after 2-5 minutes
```
‚Üí Likely: Dependency installation timeout or memory issue

**Pattern 3: Build Phase Cancellation**
```
Build started
Dependencies installed
Building application...
Build cancelled after 5-10 minutes
```
‚Üí Likely: Build timeout or memory exhaustion

**Pattern 4: Deploy Phase Cancellation**
```
Build completed successfully
Deploying to CDN...
Deploy cancelled
```
‚Üí Likely: Deploy size limits or CDN issues

### Error Messages to Look For
- \"Build exceeded maximum allowed runtime\"
- \"Out of memory\"
- \"Command failed with exit code\"
- \"Repository access denied\"
- \"Webhook delivery failed\"
- \"Environment variable not found\"
